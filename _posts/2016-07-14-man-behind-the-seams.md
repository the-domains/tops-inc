More, about the man behind the seams...

Starting out as a young teenager, David wanted to utilize the early work release program offered in his school. Unlike other teens he had little desire to work at McDonald's or a grocery store. Upon suggestion from his father, he would seek employment from Filmo's Upholstery, owned by a neighbor of David's family for many years in his modest Tampa neighborhood. Classic cars were the daily jobs. Not surprisingly, a young Mr. Leon was hooked. He still remembers the first time he did a complete interior, his own 300zx! As David states it "those seats were awful! It was so hard at first but once done I really felt a sense of accomplishment. I was able to put my own twist on the original seat design."

Fast forward to 1999, now located in West Palm Beach, here David set his mind on opening his first shop. Talk about humble beginnings! It's been said you couldn't open the doors to any vehicle while still inside the tiny bay. Small may be an understatement, but that wasn't an issue for Mr. Leon. He had control, creative control to design and build truly custom interiors, and to him that's all that mattered. At the height of Import Nights, and street tuners, Tops Inc completed one awarding winning interior after another. His once teenage boy dream of having his own shop like Filmo's was now a reality, with accolades and magazine spreads to boot.   
Today, the once 10x15 work space has grown in size and client base considerably but let's not forget Leon's talent has too.

David Leon is now backed with over 25 years of knowledge, problem solving, artistic design and material usage on not only automobile interiors but **[Aviation][0]**[, ][0]**[Motorcycle][0]**[, and ][0]**[Marine ][0]**[upholstery][0]. He has continued his obsession by utilizing modern technology, workshops, and seminars to grow along with today's new and improved methods, while always practicing the "right way to do things", because trust us, there is a wrong way. While he tailors each design to the client's tastes he never forgets the boy who just wanted to create a unique original design, puling from classic to modern techniques, his love for each car is always present. Will your vehicle be his next love affair?
