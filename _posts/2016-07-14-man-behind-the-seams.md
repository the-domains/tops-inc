# Man Behind The Seams

Since being established in 1999, the goal of Tops Inc is to provide the consumer with a truly bespoke automotive interior. Utilizing the skills of our head creative artist, David Leon and the needs of the client, combing together originality and functionality while always pushing the boundaries of design, making the impossible achievable.

We welcome you to Tops Inc, join us in making your desires a reality...

Unlike other upholstery shops Tops Inc aims to provide not only a service but an experience. From the moment you walk through our doors you will transported to a place of yesteryear and inspiration. Walls decorated in automotive memorabilia brings to life the wealth of knowledge from our founding automotive fathers, appreciating what they've started, yet knowing we can approve upon it. Here we will start the process of taking the "idea" you've been considering for days, months, maybe even decades and bring to life your desires. First on paper David will sketch out your list of "wants". Together you will select materials, some expected fabric choices to start your base design considering your taste and usage, most will be unexpected though, because after all we pride ourselves on providing the client with not just everyday automobile materials but with leather, and suede that has been modernized to truly create that _one of a kind_ interior. Once settled you may tour the shop and see how we facilitate your dreams, from our sew room, to the wood shop, no corner is left unexplored. Our shop is your shop, now. Here you will see the, how do they say? _Where the magic happens._  
We can't wait to meet you, providing an experience that will not only be unforgettable but probably your favorite memory as you (we) build the car of your dreams.

More about the man behind the seams...

Starting out as a young teenager, David wanted to utilize the early work release program offered in his school. Unlike other teens he had little desire to work at McDonald's or a grocery store. Upon suggestion from his father, he would seek employment from Filmo's Upholstery, owned by a neighbor of David's family for many years in his modest Tampa neighborhood. Classic cars were the daily jobs. Not surprisingly, a young Mr. Leon was hooked. He still remembers the first time he did a complete interior, his own 300zx! As David states it "those seats were awful! It was so hard at first but once done I really felt a sense of accomplishment. I was able to put my own twist on the original seat design."

Fast forward to 1999, now located in West Palm Beach, here David set his mind on opening his first shop. Talk about humble beginnings! It's been said you couldn't open the doors to any vehicle while still inside the tiny bay. Small may be an understatement, but that wasn't an issue for Mr. Leon. He had control, creative control to design and build truly custom interiors, and to him that's all that mattered. At the height of Import Nights, and street tuners, Tops Inc completed one awarding winning interior after another. His once teenage boy dream of having his own shop like Filmo's was now a reality, with accolades and magazine spreads to boot.   
Today, the the once 10x15 work space has grown in size and client base considerably but let's not forget Leon's talent has too. 

David Leon is now backed with over 25 years of knowledge, problem solving, artistic design and material usage on not only automobile interiors but **Aviation**, **Motorcycle**, and **Marine **upholstery. He has continued his obsession by utilizing modern technology, workshops, and seminars to grow along with today's new and improved methods, while always practicing the "right way to do things", because trust us, there is a wrong way. While he tailors each design to the client's tastes he never forgets the boy who just wanted to create a unique original design, puling from classic to modern techniques, his love for each car is always present. Will your vehicle be his next love affair?
