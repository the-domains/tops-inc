# First Visit 

## Need an estimate for a custom interior? Okay well here's what to expect... 

### From the moment you walk through our doors you will be transported to a place of yesteryear and inspiration. Walls decorated in automotive memorabilia brings to life the wealth of knowledge from our founding automotive fathers, appreciating what they've started, yet knowing we can approve upon it. Here we will start the process of taking the "idea" you've been considering for days, months, maybe even decades and bring to life your dream. First on paper David will sketch out your list of "wants". Together you will select materials, some expected fabric choices to start your base design, considering your taste and usage, most will be unexpected though, because after all we pride ourselves on providing the client with not just everyday automobile materials but with leather, and suede that has been modernized to truly create that _one of a kind_ interior. Once settled, you may tour the shop and see how we facilitate your dreams: from our sew room, to the wood shop, no corner is left unexplored. Our shop is your shop, now. Here you will see the, how do they say? _**Where the magic happens.**_
